# Model Priors Shape Experience: Reinforcement Learning for Complex Audio Reasoning


## Features

1. The **first** implementation to support the **Qwen2.5-Omni Thinker** as a base model for **complex, end-to-end reasoning over audio and other unified input modalities** (e.g., audio, image, video, text).  
2. The **first** to support **vLLM** as a rollout acceleration framework to improve GPU utilization for large-scale **omni-input language models**, including the Qwen2 and Qwen2.5-Omni series.

## Introduction

This is a training framework for **audio-based logical question answering (AQA)** tasks requiring **very complex reasoning** over real-world sound.

We use **GRPO with Dr_GRPO** to improve token efficiency while preserving high reasoning quality. Our system reinforces responses aligned with task-specific reward functions â€” a token-efficient, feedback-driven training loop. Unlike prior multimodal QA work focused on **shallow or recognition-level tasks**, our setup centers on **long-form complex reasoning from audio-text pairs**, where auditory inputs must be **understood, abstracted, and reasoned about**.

> Inspired by [*The Era of Experience* (David Silver & Richard S. Sutton, Apr, 2025)](https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/Era-of-Experience%20/The%20Era%20of%20Experience%20Paper.pdf), we treat reinforcement learning not merely as optimization, but as a vehicle for **experience generation**.
> Then we show that choosing a **strong base model** (e.g., Qwen2.5-Omni Thinker) elicits **better model trajectories**, producing higher-quality completions and thus **better learning signals** for RL.  
> This reflects the insight that **model priors shape the experience**, and that **better experience leads to better RL reasoners**.

Iâ€™m looking forward to collaborations, as I have many follow-up idea implementations to explore their scaling effects. ðŸ™‚
